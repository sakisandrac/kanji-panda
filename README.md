## Learning Goals:
At the time of this project, I am a student at Turing School of Software Engineering in the front end development program, in mod 3. This project was created for the final solo project- we have now been learning React and this project was a way to showcase all the knowlege gained from practicing React. 

## Challenges:
The biggest challenge about this project was the "my saved kanji" page. This page allows users to filter through their saved kanji by viewing all saved, kanji yet to be studied, and kanji already learned. Having the components re-render and stay in sync with each other was a challenge as there were serveral different states to keep track of.
